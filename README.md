# AID-Multilabel-Dataset: a dataset for multilabel classification of remote sensing images

AID multilabel dataset is produced from [AID scene dataset](https://captain-whu.github.io/AID/). Details are introduced in this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8986556). In total, there are 3000 aerial images (2400 training and 600 test) and 17 object labels. The size of each image is 600 x 600 pixels. The proposed dataset is now available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1he18p2yNI6IjW_cuT2lRs545pQAG7usZ). Notably, in each set, images are sorted by their scene categories, defined in AID scene dataset.
