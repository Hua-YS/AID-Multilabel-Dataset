# AID-Multilabel-Dataset

AID multilabel dataset is produced from [AID dataset](https://captain-whu.github.io/AID/). Details are introduced in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07274). In total, there are 3000 images, 2400 training and 600 test, and 17 object labels. The size of each image is 600 x 600 pixels. The proposed dataset is now available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1he18p2yNI6IjW_cuT2lRs545pQAG7usZ).
